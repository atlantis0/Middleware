{"name":"Middleware","body":"### Introduction\r\nMiddleware is a layer that exists between any two components. It acts as a mediator for the components and provides an extra capability for flexible communication. Introducing such layer has is own trade-off but the advantage weigh more than the overhead it introduces.\r\n\r\n### Aim\r\nIs to design a platform independent Middleware that facilitates wireless communication on mobile devices by using simple interfaces available through the library designed <a href = \"https://github.com/Sirack/Middleware\">here</a>.\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/Sirack/Middleware.git\r\n$ git checkout with_tcp\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Design\r\nThe design of the Middleware is divided into three parts. The first section is network creation where devices send their connection profile to the central access point. Next, near by peers are delivered to nodes once they join the network and subsequently updated reflecting the changes in the network. The full design steps are discussed in the \r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\nThe proposed design is implemented using the programming language java. You can clone the repository to get details about the Middleware. You can also checkout three independent application that are based on this Middleware. \r\n\r\n### License\r\nThe Project is free and open source. http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe project was developed by Sirack Hailu (@Sirack) and Nahom Asfaw in partial fulfillment for their BSC degree in Electrical and Computer engineering.
